Trial 

1. The User is authorized to install the Font exclusively for testing,
evaluating, comping, or presentation purposes (for instance to a
client of the User). “Install” means making the font locally
available to applications on a device.

exclusively for this purpose.

3. Any other use, whether or not commercial, is prohibited, in
particular the exploitation and dissemination of images or graphics
showing the Font, including on any Website referring to the Font in
its code or rendering text styled with the Font.

4. In order to use the Font in final work, or publish it, or otherwise
render it public, the User must have a non-trial addenda that applies
to the use.

5. The Font under this Trial license is provided on an ‘as is’
basis without any warranties of any kind, and Production Type’s
warranties in 7.3 and 7.4 do not apply.
